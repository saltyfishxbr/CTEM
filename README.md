# Conditional-Transfer-Entropy-for-Heterogeneous-Vehicle-Trajectory-Prediction (CTEM)

This is the codebase of Conditional Transfer Entropy for Heterogeneous Vehicle Trajectory Prediction submitted to KDD 2026 AI for Science Track

The code includes three parts NGSIM_data.py and TGSIM_data.py is made to process the data

cand_model.py provide CV and IDM candidate model

network.py is the main network architecture, and train_eval.py is the main file for training

finally, eval_visulization.py is to generate the plots
